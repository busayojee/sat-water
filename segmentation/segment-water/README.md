## SEGMENTATION OF WATERBODIES TAKEN BY SATELLITES

## Introduction
Satellite imagery is a rich source of information, and the accurate segmentation of water bodies is crucial for understanding environmental patterns and changes over time. This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for extracting water regions from raw satellite images.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is gotten here [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies). It consists of jpeg images of water bodies taken by satellites and their mask. More details of the dataset is provided on the website.

## Installation
To get started with the project you can clone this repo. 

```git clone https://github.com/busayojee/Satellite-imagery.git```

```cd segmentation/segment-water```
